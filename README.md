# 🛠️ WordPress Troubleshooting Project

This is my **first WordPress troubleshooting project**, built as part of my learning journey to gain **real freelance or remote work**. It documents actual WordPress issues I recreated and fixed using **LocalWP**, focusing on realistic problems clients face daily.

Each case includes a **before/after screenshot**, a short explanation, and a clear, step-by-step solution. The goal is to build hands-on experience, demonstrate problem-solving skills, and help others who face the same issues.
